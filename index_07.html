                    <p>
                        Over the years, the world has witnessed an emphatic shift toward impact-driven research. This
                        development is evident in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), where research
                        innovation plays a crucial role in addressing challenges in healthcare, water, sanitation,
                        agriculture, and education. Emphasizing the need for transformative research that influences
                        industries, policies, and communities, the European Commission (2020) acknowledges research
                        innovation as a key driver of societal progress. The World Bank (2021) and the Organization for
                        Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2015) also emphasize the importance of research
                        innovation, especially in developing economies. While the OECD recognizes the importance of
                        science, technology, and interdisciplinary collaboration, the World Bank, through both words and
                        actions, highlights the roles of universities, research centers, and industry partnerships not
                        only in generating knowledge but also in transforming it into real-world solutions that have a
                        meaningful impact on sustainable growth. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        In an era when innovation has been widely recognized, such as by the World Bank, European
                        Commission, and OECD, as the foundation of sustainable development, the World Bank Africa Higher
                        Education Centres of Excellence for Development Impact (ACE Impact) project serves as an engine
                        of revolutionary change. With a laser focus on strengthening higher education and research
                        institutions, ACE Impact is driving innovation that directly addresses Africa’s most pressing
                        developmental challenges. From pioneering cutting-edge science to spearheading futuristic
                        technology to fostering interdisciplinary collaborations and industry partnerships to nurturing
                        entrepreneurial mindsets, the project is redefining the role of higher education in spurring
                        economic growth and societal progress. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>A critical contribution of ACE Impact is its rare innate ability to align academic research with
                        real African needs. Through multidisciplinary research and development initiatives, ACE centres
                        produce context-specific solutions in areas such as health, agriculture, engineering, and
                        digital technology. By adequately strategically resourcing and empowering researchers, the
                        project ensures that the knowledge generated within African universities translates into
                        tangible innovations that benefit both communities and industries.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>At the heart of modern development is digital transformation; with this recognition, ACE Impact
                        integrates technology in higher education and research. Many ACEs have developed and deployed
                        technological innovations in e-learning, telemedicine, and artificial intelligence to tackle
                        challenges in education, healthcare, and other critical sectors. For instance, ACE Impact has
                        introduced digital learning platforms and tech-enabled teaching methodologies, supported the
                        digitalization of academic programs and expanded higher education beyond physical campuses to
                        make it responsive to the demands of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Extending higher education innovation beyond technological advancements, the ACE Impact project
                        has also institutionalized an ecosystem where creativity lives and thrives. The project has
                        catalyzed this transformation by investing in cutting-edge research, strengthening
                        industry-academia partnerships, and providing students with opportunities to apply their
                        knowledge to real-world problems. The program has supported and empowered its numerous Centers
                        of Excellence to develop innovative academic programs tailored to Africa’s developmental needs.
                        By funding applied research and strengthening curriculum relevance, ACE Impact has ensured that
                        graduates are not only academically competent but also equipped with problem-solving skills
                        critical for the job market. </p>

                    <p>Also recognizing that innovation thrives in an environment that enables entrepreneurship, ACE
                        Impact has integrated entrepreneurship training into its academic programs, encouraging students
                        and faculty to transform research ideas into viable businesses. As a result, its ACEs have
                        established innovation hubs and business incubation centers, providing mentorship, funding, and
                        market access for startups emerging from research outputs. These initiatives are not only
                        strengthening Africa’s innovation ecosystem but also generating employment opportunities. In a
                        recent ACE Graduate Tracer survey, independently conducted by China’s MyCos, one in every ten
                        ACE Impact graduates reported having established their own business and contributing to Africa’s
                        entrepreneurial ecosystem. Almost all (98%) of the 4,295 PhD and master’s graduates surveyed
                        reported having been significantly impacted by the ACE model.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Another marked feature of ACE Impact is its emphasis on strong industry-academia linkages. The
                        project has facilitated partnerships between and among universities and key industry players to
                        co-develop curricula, conduct joint research, and implement work-integrated learning programs.
                        These collaborations have significantly enhanced graduates’ employability, ensuring that
                        industries access a skilled workforce equipped with relevant expertise and innovative
                        problem-solving capabilities. The independent ACE Graduate Tracer survey also found that over
                        80% of the project’s graduates secured their ideal employment within the first six months of
                        graduation.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Beyond the direct technological and research innovations, ACE Impact also plays a crucial role in
                        influencing policy and institutional reforms. By implementing and advocating robust quality
                        assurance frameworks, accreditation processes, and performance-based funding mechanisms, the
                        project is enhancing the governance and operational efficiency of higher education institutions.
                        These reforms are pivotal in ensuring long-term sustainability and scalability of
                        innovation-driven development in Africa.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Sustaining the momentum of innovation remains a priority as the ACE Impact project ends in June
                        2025. Future efforts focus on deepening industry linkages, securing sustainable funding models,
                        and expanding digital education infrastructure. The World Bank has been collaborating with
                        governments, policymakers, and academic leaders to create an enabling environment that fosters
                        innovation, ensuring Africa’s knowledge institutions remain at the forefront of addressing
                        developmental challenges, especially in healthcare.</p>

                        <p>Many have likely wondered how many women in sub-Saharan Africa lose their lives due to
                            pregnancy or its management, only to be confronted with a heartbreaking reality they wish
                            they didn’t know. According to the latest (2010-2020) data on maternal mortality rates,
                            jointly published by the World Bank, WHO, UNICEF, UNPF, and UNPD, sub-Saharan Africa alone
                            contributes a staggering 70% of the world's maternal mortality rate. Beyond statistically
                            pushing the world average from 53 to 223, the region’s alarming 545 maternal deaths per
                            100,000 live births pose a severe threat to the Sustainable Development Goal Target 3.1,
                            which aims to reduce maternal mortality to fewer than 70 by 2030. With only five years
                            remaining, the World Bank ACE Impact project provides a glimmer of hope.</p>
                        <br>

                       

                        <p>The Bank’s Centre of Excellence in Reproductive Health Innovation
                            (CERHI) is diligently
                            working to ensure that the 2030 target remains achievable, leveraging the synergy of
                            innovation, commitment, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. As part of this pursuit, the
                            center recently identified widespread inaccessible emergency healthcare as a major cause of
                            the region’s high maternal mortality rates and proposed actionable solutions to address the
                            issue. Diagnosing the problem, the center first summarized the region’s high maternal
                            mortality rates in a 3-delay model—the delay in deciding to seek care, the delay in reaching
                            care, and the delay in receiving care, with the first phase being the most critical not only
                            because the two other phases depend on it but also because it combines their
                            causes—inaccessible health facilities and poor-quality healthcare—with other causes such as
                            socio-economic and cultural factors. This means that by addressing Phase 1 delays, maternal
                            mortality rates could be significantly reduced. </p>

                        Farming in Northern Ghana</h2>
                    <p>In rural communities across Northern Ghana, access to clean and safe drinking water has been
                        a persistent challenge. Water bodies, once reliable sources, have become contaminated with
                        hazardous levels of heavy metals such as arsenic and mercury, largely due to the rise of
                        unregulated mining activities. Unfortunately, filtering and removing these contaminants is
                        an expensive and complex process. </p><br>

                    <p>
                        This contamination poses severe health risks, particularly for vulnerable populations who
                        rely on these water sources for their daily needs. In response to this pressing challenge,
                        the West African Centre for Water, Irrigation and Sustainable Agriculture (WACWISA) at the
                        University for Development Studies (UDS), developed a groundbreaking, low-cost ceramic water
                        filter. This innovation is not only transforming health outcomes but also empowering
                        communities by utilizing locally available materials.
                    </p><br>

                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="/public_html/subs/ceramic_filter.jpg" alt="Water Filter" class="article-image">
                        <div class="image-caption">Locally-produced ceramic water filters are transforming
                            health outcomes</div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="highlight">
                        <p>The WACWISA ceramic filter employs agricultural by-products such as rice husks,
                            sheanut shells, and groundnut shells, combined with zeolite for enhanced
                            filtration.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>These materials are charred, milled, and mixed with clay, then fired in a kiln at 850°C to
                        create durable ceramic filters. This process effectively removes up to 98.7% of arsenic and
                        mercury from water, offering a life-changing solution for those affected by water pollution.
                        <b>Over 200 individuals in five rural communities</b> have benefited from these filters,
                        significantly improving access to clean water and reducing the prevalence of waterborne
                        diseases.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>The success of the project is not only in the technology itself but also in the community
                        engagement and knowledge transfer facilitated by WACWISA. <b>Local residents have been
                            trained to produce these filters</b>, creating a sustainable model that empowers
                        communities to manage their water quality independently. This initiative not only addresses
                        health concerns but also promotes economic growth by fostering local entrepreneurship and
                        reducing reliance on costly imported solutions.</p><br>
                    <h3>Impact and Future Potential</h3>
                    <p>The ceramic filters provide an affordable, scalable, and environmentally friendly method for
                        purifying water. By using locally sourced materials, production costs are minimized, making
                        the filters accessible to even the most resource-constrained households. The filters'
                        ability to remove harmful heavy metals dramatically reduces the risks of chronic diseases
                        such as cancer and neurological disorders, which are linked to arsenic and mercury exposure.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>A benefit-cost analysis of the project revealed a favorable <b>ratio of 1.06</b>, indicating
                        the viability of scaling this solution as a profitable and sustainable business venture. As
                        the technology gains traction, <b>it has the potential to benefit thousands more across
                            Ghana and beyond</b>. The simplicity of the production process, combined with the
                        effectiveness of the filters, makes it an ideal solution for widespread adoption in regions
                        grappling similar water contamination challenges.Looking forward, WACWISA aims to expand the
                        reach of this innovation by partnering with governmental and non-governmental organizations
                        to facilitate mass production and distribution. By continuing to train local communities and
                        build capacity, this project is poised to ensure that every household in Northern Ghana—and
                        potentially across Africa—has access to clean, safe drinking water.</p><br>

                    <p>Beyond this key innovation, the center has significantly improved the livelihoods of
                        people, especially local farmers in Ghana through other tailored innovations. These
                        include improved shea roaster to boost productivity for women in Northern Ghana. Shea
                        butter processing is a vital source of income for rural women in Northern Ghana, yet
                        traditional methods are labor-intensive, inefficient, and contribute to environmental
                        degradation. To address these issues, <b>WACWISA, in collaboration with UNIDO, developed
                            an improved Shea roaster</b> using locally available materials. This innovative
                        roaster, distributed to <b>14 women’s groups</b> across the Upper East, Upper West, and
                        Northern regions, has transformed the Shea butter production process. The new technology
                        led to a <b>40% increase in butter yield and a 30% improvement in fatty acid quality</b>
                        (Stearic, Oleic, Palmitic, and Linoleic). Additionally, the roaster ensures heat
                        distribution, reduces fuelwood consumption, and minimizes environmental impact.</p><br>


                    <p>The initiative has trained <b>504 Shea butter processors</b> and <b>28 local
                            fabricators</b>, equipping communities with the skills and tools to sustain their
                        livelihoods. This breakthrough not only improves productivity and quality but also
                        supports the fight against climate change, offering rural women a path to economic
                        empowerment and environmental sustainability.</p><br>

                    <p>Amid global water scarcity, traditional irrigation methods often result in water waste
                        and reduced crop yields. To tackle this challenge, <b>WACWISA researchers adopted a
                            data-driven approach</b> to design a smart irrigation system specifically for tomato
                        farming. By modeling soil moisture dynamics and using <b>MATLAB-based predictive control
                            algorithms</b>, this system adapts irrigation to real-time conditions, optimizing
                        water use. Field trials demonstrated that this smart irrigation approach achieved a
                        <b>29% reduction in water usage</b> and significantly improved water use
                        efficiency—yielding up to <b>10.4 kg of tomatoes per cubic meter of water </b> (compared
                        to 7.1 kg/m³ for open-loop and 5.6 kg/m³ for manual methods). The system accurately
                        predicts irrigation needs, reducing both over- and under-watering, and lowering
                        operational costs for farmers.
                    </p><br>
                    <p><b>This innovation has empowered hundreds of farmers to increase their yields</b> while
                        conserving water, paving the way for more sustainable agricultural practices. The
                        results underscore the potential of smart irrigation to revolutionize water management,
                        offering a scalable solution for agricultural stakeholders confronted with water
                        scarcity.</p><br>
                    <p>The success of these initiatives underscores the relevance of research and innovation in
                        addressing real-world problems. By introducing improved ceramic filters, shea butter
                        roasters, and smart irrigation systems, WACWISA is changing lives, fostering healthier
                        communities, and paving the way for sustainable, locally driven solutions across Africa.

                            poultry farming in Togo</div>
                    </div>
                    <p>In Togo, poultry farming plays a pivotal role in the agricultural economy, accounting for 14%
                        of the sector's GDP. Despite this importance, the industry has long struggled with high
                        costs and a heavy dependency on imported feed concentrates, which represent 70% of
                        production costs. These challenges have limited productivity and forced the country to rely
                        on significant poultry imports to meet national demands.</p><br>

                    <h3>The Problem: Expensive and Imported Feed</h3>
                    <p>The high cost of imported feed concentrates has hindered the growth of modern poultry farming
                        in Togo, leading to inefficiencies and disinvestment by farmers. In 2020, the country
                        imported 24,717 tonnes of poultry meat and offal to address the production gap. Without
                        affordable, high-quality feed, the poultry industry continues to struggle to meet the
                        national demand and remains uncompetitive.</p><br>
                    <div class="highlight">
                        <p>To address this challenge, the <b>Regional Center of Excellence in Poultry Sciences
                                (CERSA)</b> developed an innovative feed concentrate made from <b>black soldier fly
                                maggots</b>. This locally produced concentrate offers high nutritional and
                            microbiological quality, rivaling imported alternatives. It provides essential proteins,
                            vitamins, and minerals needed to balance poultry feed rations, reducing reliance on
                            costly imports and supporting sustainable farming practices.</p>
